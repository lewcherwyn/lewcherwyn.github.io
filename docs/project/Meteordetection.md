#Rapid Meteor Detection (my bachelor thesis)

Meteor detection is a very interesting topic. After completing most of my observatory construction work, 
I finally had the opportunity to build my own meteor camera system. The hardware for the monitoring device 
can be simple, all you need just a camera with a lens. After that, we need a software such as Ufocapture 
or RMS to detect the video stream and record the suspected meteor video.

However, most of these software are based on motion-detection algorithms, and some small flickering such as 
airplanes or bugs will trigger false alarms and record them. Therefore, it is necessary to manually 
review the candidate videos of the night.

## Can the process of manually reviewing videos be replaced by AI?
Certainly. The task of reviewing the videos is simple and mechanical, as the advanced AI algorithms available 
today are capable of recognizing almost any object. However, real-time detection places significant demands on 
computer performance and most of the setups used for recording such as mini PC or Raspberry Pi, do not 
have a powerful GPU. Therefore, compressing the entire video's information becomes highly meaningful.
